Machine learning (ML) enabled systems are emerging with recent breakthroughs in ML. A model-centric view is widely taken by the literature to focus only on the analysis~of~ML~models. However, only a small body of work takes a system view that~looks at how ML components work with the system and how they affect software engineering for ML-enabled systems. In this paper, we adopt this system view, and conduct~a~case study on Rasa~3.0,~an industrial dialogue system that has been widely adopted by various companies around~the world.~Our~goal~is~to~characterize~the~complexity of such a large-scale ML-enabled system~and~to~understand the~impact of the complexity on testing. Our study reveals~practical implications for software engineering for ML-enabled systems.
