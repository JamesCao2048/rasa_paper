We present a comprehensive study on Rasa to characterize its complexity at three levels and the impact of its complexity on testing from two perspectives.
Furthermore, we highlight practical implications to improve software engieering for ML-enabled systems.
All study data and source code used in this paper are available at \url{https://rasasystemcomplexity.github.io/}.
