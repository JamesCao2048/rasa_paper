 Moreover, the way to decide whether a mutant is killed in ML programs is through performance metrics instead of the running status of test cases like traditional software. As Rasa is a complex dialog system that contain both ML components and rule-based components, we consider both mutation operators for traditional softwares (i.e. \textit{syntactic mutation operators}) and machine learning specific mutation operators (i.e. \textit{ML specific mutation operators}).
As Table \ref{mutation_operator} shown, we adopted 9 \textit{syntactic mutation operators} from Jia et al. \cite{JiaMutation} and 11 \textit{ML specific mutation operators} from DeepCrime \cite{DeepCrime}.
